Using ubuntu, run `sudo service postgresql start` to initiate the postgres database.

Switch to your VS Code and run `npm install` to install the required packages. After installing the packages, run `npm start` to allow the front end to begin opening up. While this is opening, run `npm run seed:dev` to create the seed data. Once the seed data is finished, run `start:dev` to begin running the server.

After you begin running the server and the front end opens up a page on your localhost:3000, you should now be able to access the website.
