Using ubuntu, run `sudo service postgresql start` to initiate the postgres database.

Switch to your VS Code and run `npm install` to install the required packages. After installing the packages, run `npm start` to allow the front end to begin opening up.

After the front end opens up a page on your localhost:3000, you should now be able to access the website which will be linked to a heroku server containing the PostgreSQL database.
